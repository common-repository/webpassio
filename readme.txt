Adblockers are costing you more and more money. Many who use adblockers realise this and want to support your site without ads. Why not offer them that option? A subscription option for your most loyal users to pay for no ads. A single subscription that gives them ad-free content across many websites, including yours!

Currently only supports disabling ads when you use the Google Adsense plugin. More plugins to be supported soon.
